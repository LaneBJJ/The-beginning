# The-beginning
A basic "gist" of my progress in javascript. I will be writing just as I would be when logging to the console! 
Current subjects being uploaded, I'll likely add one every day; if/else statements, functions, template literals, utilizing strict mode here and there, as well as some others I may remember to utilize here and there for some fundementals practice.

const firstName = Lane;
const age = 18;

// I want to create an if/else statement, to know if I am able to drive yet or not!

if age >= 16 {
console.log(`${firstName} is legal to drive!)
} else {
console.log(`${firstName} is not legal to drive!`)
}

I will add to this if/else statement to make it more complicated as well!
